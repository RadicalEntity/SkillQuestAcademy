        <h1>House of Web</h1>
        <p> Welcome to the thrilling House of Web, a minigame that concludes our
            Introduction to Web Development lesson. You'll navigate through a seemingly 
            infinite number of floors, each randomly generated to test your knowledge 
            of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As you progress through the House of Web, 
            you'll encounter different floors, each representing one of the three topics. 
            Get ready to face challenging questions related to HTML elements, CSS 
            styling, and JavaScript concepts. But don't worry, it's all in good fun!
        </p>
        <p> Here's how it works: Once you enter a floor, a question will appear on the 
            screen. Use your web development knowledge to answer correctly. If you get 
            it right, you'll proceed to the next level, advancing further into the 
            digital house. However, beware! If you answer incorrectly, you'll be 
            dejected back to the start, just like in any quest. But don't let that 
            discourage you; the House of Web is meant to challenge you, and it's a great 
            opportunity to reinforce what you've learned.
        </p>
        <p> In total, there are 15 floors to conquer, so stay sharp and focused as you 
            navigate through the halls of web development. Remember, every correct answer 
            brings you closer to the end of the game, where you'll emerge as a confident 
            and skilled web developer.
        </p>
        <p> Have fun exploring the House of Web, and don't forget to face each question 
            with determination. You've got this!
